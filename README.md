📷pic_style_changer

📝Description:
pic_style_changer is an image processing application that lets users apply different visual effects to images in real time. It features a combo box (comboBox.getItems().addAll("Grayscale", "Invert", "Blur")) with several style options.

These are not just names in a list — each selected option actively applies a corresponding image processing filter:

    ⭐️Grayscale – Converts the image to grayscale using pixel-by-pixel transformation.

    ⭐️Invert – Inverts the color values of each pixel for a negative-like effect.

    ⭐️Blur – Applies a blur filter to create a soft, smooth look.

This project demonstrates practical use of image manipulation techniques and GUI interaction through JavaFX (or your chosen framework).
